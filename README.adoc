= PS CC Four in One

This photoshop script is used to add four pictures into one, to be able to print them with link:https://www.cewe.de/fotos.html[cewe] as an 13cm Foto. The fotos are added and arranged at the corners.

== How to use?

I use VSCode with `Adobe Script Runner` Extension to directly execute the Javascript File in Photoshop. But it should also be possible to load the script into Photoshop and execute it from there. I didn't test this.
